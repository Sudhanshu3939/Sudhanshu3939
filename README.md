## 🚀 What I Do

### 🧠 Machine Learning & AI
- LLM Fine-tuning (LoRA, QLoRA, PEFT)
- RAG applications using LangChain, Chroma
- Deep Learning with PyTorch
- Model deployment with FastAPI, Docker
- Real-time ML pipelines with Kafka, Spark

### 🛠 Backend Engineering
- Spring Boot & Microservices
- FastAPI, Flask
- Secure REST APIs (JWT, OAuth2)
- Event-driven systems (Kafka, RabbitMQ)

### ☁️ MLOps & Cloud
- AWS (S3, Lambda, ECS, EC2, SageMaker)
- Docker, GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Airflow, MLflow, DVC
- Monitoring with Grafana, CloudWatch

## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🔥 LLM Fine-Tuning & Deployment (Mistral-7B, QLoRA)
Fine-tuned and deployed a 4-bit quantized LLM for summarization using QLoRA + vLLM.  
Built API via FastAPI → Docker → AWS ECS.

### 📄 RAG-based Chatbot (PDF & Image Understanding)
Multimodal RAG system that extracts text, images & tables from PDFs.  
Backend: FastAPI + LangChain + Chroma  
Frontend: Streamlit  
CI/CD: GitHub Actions

### ⚡ Kafka + Spark Real-Time ML Pipeline
Real-time YouTube comment sentiment pipeline.  
Airflow DAGs for orchestration, MLflow for tracking, deployed on SageMaker.

### 🏗️ Spring Cloud Microservices for Supply Chain
Distributed system with Vendor, Order & Logistics microservices.  
Kafka for events, Spring Cloud for discovery/config, OAuth2/JWT for auth, deployed on Kubernetes (EKS).
